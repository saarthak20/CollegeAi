## Machine Learning: Study Notes

### Introduction

*   Machine learning (ML) empowers computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
*   ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance through experience.
*   Key abilities include understanding, reasoning, and adaptation to new information.

### Key Concepts

*   **How it Works:**
    *   ML algorithms learn from historical data to create predictive models.
    *   New data is processed using these models to make predictions or classifications.
    *   Model accuracy generally improves with increased data volume.

*   **Types of Machine Learning:**
    *   **Supervised Learning:**
        *   Employs labeled data (input features paired with known outputs).
        *   Model learns the relationship between features and labels.
        *   Used for prediction on new, unseen data.
        *   *Example:* Predicting currency type from coin weight.
    *   **Unsupervised Learning:**
        *   Utilizes unlabeled data.
        *   Model identifies patterns, clusters, or relationships within the data.
        *   No prior knowledge of categories is required.
        *   *Example:* Grouping cricket players based on performance metrics (runs, wickets).
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:**
        *   Operates on a reward-based system.
        *   Model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback for actions.
        *   Adjusts strategy to maximize rewards.

*   **Real-World Applications:**
    *   Healthcare: Diagnostics
    *   Sentiment Analysis: Social media monitoring
    *   Fraud Detection: Financial transactions
    *   E-commerce: Customer churn prediction
    *   Dynamic Pricing: Surge pricing strategies

### Summary

*   Machine learning facilitates data-driven prediction and decision-making without explicit programming.
*   Key techniques include:
    *   Supervised Learning (labeled data)
    *   Unsupervised Learning (unlabeled data)
    *   Reinforcement Learning (learning through feedback)
*   Applications are expanding across various industries.
