## Title: Machine Learning

## Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. It focuses on developing algorithms that can learn and make predictions or decisions.

## Section 1: How Machine Learning Works
ML algorithms identify patterns in data to build predictive models. These models are then used to make predictions on new, unseen data. More data generally results in more accurate models.

## Section 2: Types of Machine Learning
*   **Supervised Learning:** Trains on *labeled* data. Example: Predicting house prices based on size and location.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds hidden patterns in *unlabeled* data. Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties. Example: Training a self-driving car.

## Example
**Fraud Detection:** Machine learning models analyze transaction data to identify potentially fraudulent activities, flagging them for review.

## Summary
- Machine learning empowers computers to learn from data.
- Key types include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
- Big data and powerful computing have driven the growth of ML and its widespread adoption.
